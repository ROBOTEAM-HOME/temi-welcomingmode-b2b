This is an example skill that uses tÄ“mi's Welcoming Mode.


## Installation
```
adb install -r -t /path/to/welcomingmode-b2b.apk
```

You can find releases [here](https://github.com/ray-hrst/temi-welcomingmode-b2b/releases)


## How to Modify
* All Japanese text should appear in:
	*  `app/src/main/res/values-ja-rJP/strings.xml`.
* To remove a `feature` or `button` edit: 
	* `app/src/main/res/values/arrays.xml`.
* To change the behaviour of a `feature`, edit:
	*  `app/src/main/java/com/robotemi/welcomingbtob/featurelist/FeatureListFragment.kt`. 
	* For example, a feature could be used to launch another app:
		```
	  	protected void launchApp(String packageName) {
	        Intent mIntent = getPackageManager().getLaunchIntentForPackage(packageName);

	        if (mIntent != null) {
	            try {
	                startActivity(mIntent);
	            } catch (ActivityNotFoundException err) {
	                Toast t = Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), R.string.app_not_found, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT);
	                t.show();
	            }
	        }
	    }
		```
